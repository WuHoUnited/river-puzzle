# river-puzzle

This project contains a single source file `src/river-puzzle/river-puzzle.clj`
which solves a japanese river-crossing puzzle in using `Clojure` and `core.logic`.

The puzzle which this problem is based on can be found at http://www.japaneseiqtest.net/

The source file is well-commented and should be able to be understood by somebody
relatively new to `core.logic` or logic programming.

## Usage

Just browse the code, or fire it up in a repl
